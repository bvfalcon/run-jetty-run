# Run Jetty Run

- Run web applications with Jetty and Eclipse in one click!

- Full maven support , simply run maven J2EE project without any config.

- [GettingStarted](https://github.com/xzer/run-jetty-run/wiki/GettingStarted) explains it all.  Please see [FutureDirectionsDiscussion](https://github.com/xzer/run-jetty-run/wiki/FutureDirectionsDiscussion) to participate in the evolution of Run Jetty Run.

## Install

[update site list](http://bvfalcon.github.io/run-jetty-run/).

***Due to the Java 8 lambda issue, the nightly build is recommended.***

## About Java 11

Jetty supports Java 11 from version 9.4.13. 

***IMPORTANT***

To use RJR with jetty 9.4.8 (and later) Java 9 support, you need add the following vm args to your launch configuration or you will get error as "java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/xml/bind/JAXBException":

```
--add-modules java.xml.bind
```

### Migrate Note

Directly upgrading from old version to the current nightly build is not supported. Uninstall the old version via eclipse's plugin manager at first, then follow the [GettingStarted](https://github.com/xzer/run-jetty-run/wiki/GettingStarted) to install the newest nightly version.

The current 1.3.5 nightly build can be automatically updated.

## Why this plugin? ##

Because running a web application in Eclipse should be as simple as 'clicking run'. No additional setup required.


## The difference with WTP Jetty Integration ##

We think there are some benefits to use Run-Jetty-Run instead of WTP:

- Performance
    WTP always copy all the resources to a temp folder , that slow down the process and  you have to stop server then clean the resource sometimes if the resource locked. WTP solution also takes more time to start and terminate a web application.

- The maven support
    It's a annoying to run maven based web application in WTP. Since we use same project classpath with default Eclipse JDT , so we could support maven dependency management (M2Eclipse Plug-in) easily. (Note that RunJettyRun did not required to install a maven plug-in , it's optional.)

- Less steps to setup and run
    For using WTP Jetty ,  you have to install Jetty\_WTP\_Plugin , then find a runtime for it , that took your time to download a runtime and config it. You still have 3-4 steps after you install WTP plugin.But if you use RunJettyRun , there's already a built-in Jetty lib in the plug-in , simply "run" a project with Jetty by one click.

- Also support Java project.
    Easy to use Jetty for every Java project but also a Dynamic Web Project , if you are writing some web widget , it's easy to test it with RJR.


## Other benefits ##

- Working with Eclipse JDT debugging/ hot deploy
    When you running RJR in debug mode , you could modify the code and apply it directly. Of course, all the breakpoint/inspector for java resource is working fine.
